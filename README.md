In this project I used data (estimates) from the **Global Burden of Disease (GBD)** study to explore the relationships between different measurements of health burden (deaths, YLLs, YLDs, DALYS). Worked with a very small subset of the overall GBD data that looks at the most recent estimates of disease burden in India. Finally created a report that documented my insights from exploring the data.

I began by computing years of life lost (YLLs) and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) from the data provided. I then described and interpreted the differences in disease burden based on the four different metrics of health burden. To keep it clear and concise I wrote separate sections that compared the metrics of disease burden in three different ways: by **cause**, across **age-groups**, and also by **sex**.

This project contains :
- A summary paragraph describing/interpreting the differences in health burden (by cause) with an visual representation
- A summary paragraph describing/interpreting the differences in health burden (by age) with an visual representation
- A summary paragraph describing/interpreting the differences in health burden (by sex) with an visual representation

In this project :
- Writing a report with RMarkdown
- Computing measurements of health burden (YLLs, DALYs)
- Manipulating data to ask interesting questions of the dataset
- Interpreting results, and incorporating any additional information
